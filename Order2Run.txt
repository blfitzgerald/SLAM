Step1:
If you need to create the watershed average precipitation daily files: [RunFile is path/to/SLAMSetup.txt] 
condor_submit /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/1.PP2WAP.sub RunFile=/home/lyan68/SLAMShare/Runs/TestDuwamish4/SLAMSetup.txt 

Check that all files were created: [Input is the which data type AORC or NCG, and where the daily WAPs are]
python /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/1p.CheckMissingWAPs.py 'AORC' '/home/lyan68/SLAMShare/Runs/TestDuwamish16'

Then TAR the WAP daily files into yearly, then if desired  can remove daily files and move yearly tars to somewhere else, i.e. projects folder 
/mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/1p.tarWAPs.sh $PP2WAPOUT $FIRSTYEAR $LASTYEAR
rm *WAP.nc4
mv WAPs.tar $WAPLOC

/mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/1p.tarWAPs.sh /home/lyan68/SLAMShare/Runs/TestDuwamish16 1979 2021


Step2:
Then need to calculate annual maxima for each duration:
for all the possible transpositions/grids, calculate the ws average AM precip
condor_submit /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/2.AMC.sub $RunFile $DUR
python /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/2p.CombineAM.py $AMCOUT $DUR $PRECVAR $FIRSTYEAR $LASTYEAR

condor_submit /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/2.AMC.sub RunFile=/home/lyan68/SLAMShare/Runs/TestKanawha16/SLAMSetup.txt DUR=72
python /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/2p.CombineAM.py AMCOUT=/home/lyan68/SLAMShare/Runs/TestDuwamish16/ 72 precrate 1979 2021


Step3:
Then need to create the setup files for the L-Moment Calculation
condor_submit /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/3a.LMS.sub $RunFile $DUR
python /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/3ap.CombineTextInputs.py $LMSOUT

condor_submit /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/3a.LMS.sub RunFile=/home/lyan68/SLAMShare/Runs/TestDuwamish16/SLAMSetup.txt DUR=72



condor_submit /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/3b.LMC.sub $RunFile $DUR
python /mnt/cephfs/fuse/projects/CEE_Wright/lyan68/SLAM/Codes/3bp.CombineLMs.py $LMCOUT $NumberLMs $DUR
